# DBMS_Mini_PROJECT-Patent_Registration_Database_System

The purpose of the Patent Registration Database System is to make the filing, reviewing, and managing of patents more efficient. Through the system, applicants—individuals or organizations—can register their inventions, submit
applications, attach supporting documentation, and pay the required fees. Examiners have the ability to assign statuses, review applications, and monitor
legal developments. Better transparency in the intellectual property management
process, effective retrieval, and organized storage of patent-related data are all
guaranteed by this system.
